I am a Senior earning my Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science with a minor in General Business.

I grew up in Underwood, Iowa which is about 25 minutes from Omaha. I went Iowa Western Community College in Council Bluffs and earned my associates degree in Management Information Systems. I transferred to Northwest the next semester. I've recently been getting into The Adobe Creative Cloud Applications especially After Effects and have been doing little snippet animations. 

My plans after graduation are to maybe work with kids, and teaching them about computers. I was a camp counselor this past summer and I really enjoyed it! But I would be fine with getting about any job that would interest me. I might be looking for more of a front development since I've been practicing some graphic design in my free time.

A fun fact about me is I used to play tuba in high school; I hope to pick back up sometime and join a community band.
